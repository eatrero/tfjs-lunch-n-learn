# TensorFlow.js Example: Transfer Learning 

This example shows you how to do image classifications from a webcam using transfer
learning.

In this example, we'll use a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and train another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict N different photos from the
webcam defined by the user.
